    <title>About Myself</title>
    <p> Hi! I'm Maricar. I am currently working in a government sector. 
        I have graduated last year as an IT, but I want to learn more about programming. I am loving this bootcamp because the way they teach is  so beginner friendly. It is only day 2 but I learn so much from them!
